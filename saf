SAF_black_monday_crisis:0 "Recovery from Black Monday?"
SAF_black_monday_crisis_desc:0 "The economic crisis threatens to tear the Union apart. We must reform our country's economy to solve mass unemployment, but the Volksraad stands divided on the path to take forwards. This choice will certainly have repercussions in the years to come, and may even exacerbate existing divides."
SAF_representation_natives_act:0 "Representation of Natives Act"
SAF_representation_natives_act_desc:0 "Originally planned before the current economic crisis took hold, the Representation of Natives Act of 1936 will become the centrepiece of upcoming social and political reforms within the country. The original provisions will probably have to be altered significantly, however."
SAF_paramount_chiefs:0 "Establish the Paramount Chiefs"
SAF_paramount_chiefs_desc:0 "Granting autonomy to the local rulers of the former HCTs will allow us to install new, autonomous Paramount Chiefs of their respective ethnic groups (the Tswana in Bechuanaland, the Basotho in Basutoland and the Swazi in Swaziland) loyal to the central government."
SAF_develop_provinces:0 "Develop the Protectorates"
SAF_develop_provinces_desc:0 "The crown protectorates are perhaps the least-developed regions in the Union - it is vital that we develop their infrastructure to maintain pace with the rest of the country."
SAF_develop_provinces_2:0 "Continue Developing the Protectorates"
SAF_develop_provinces_2_desc:0 "With the infrastructure of the protectorates developed, we can now focus on developing their industry - as well as the industry of the surrounding areas, for which the protectorates often serve as a source of cheap labour."
SAF_native_autonomy:0 "The Question of Native Autonomy"
SAF_native_autonomy_desc:0 "We have decided to grant autonomy to the local rulers of the former High Commission Territories, the new Paramount Chiefs of the respective ethnic groups (the Tswana in Bechuanaland, the Basotho in Basutoland and the Swazi in Swaziland). But we need to clarify the extent of the Chiefs power - is it limited to within the borders of the former HCT or does it encompass all of their peoples throughout South Africa?"
SAF_paramount_forces:0 "Forces of the Paramount Chiefs"
SAF_paramount_forces_desc:0 "Given the increased autonomy of the Paramount Chiefs, some of them are asking to be allowed to raise their own forces comprised of their respective tribesmen to better secure their own positions. While arming natives is an unpalatable prospect, it would reduce the strain upon the Union's armed forces."
SAF_askari_corps:0 "The South African Askari Corps"
SAF_askari_corps_desc:0 "Now that we have armed certain ethnic groups, hawks in the Volksraad are suggesting that we may as well raise our own native units, ones that would be loyal not to the Paramount Chiefs but to the Union."
SAF_nuweveld:0 "Establish the Nuweveld"
SAF_nuweveld_desc:0 "Turning the newly annexed territories over to white settlers will encourage the establishment of new settlements throughout the Nuweveld and the cultural integration of the new regions. The locals however would lose access to most agricultural lands, forcing them to migrate to the cities for work as transient labour."
SAF_nuweveld_settlements:0 "Begin Settling the Nuweveld"
SAF_nuweveld_settlements_desc:0 "The annexation of new territory is only the first step - now we must actually develop those lands, and ensure that they are finally being put to productive use."
SAF_expand_mines:0 "Mining the Nuweveld"
SAF_expand_mines_desc:0 "The new reserves of native labour allow us to significantly expand our mining capacity in the Nuweveld, giving us the potential of producing ores on an industrial scale."
SAF_native_labour:0 "Native Labour"
SAF_native_labour_desc:0 "The integration of the Nuweveld territories and the desperate need for cheap and plentiful labour in those regions has raised the issue of Native rights. Many politicians are now ready to make radical compromises in a few categories."
SAF_expand_steelworks:0 "Vanderbijlpark's Steelworks"
SAF_expand_steelworks_desc:0 "The new reserves of native labour allow us to significantly expand South Africa's steel production with a new large-scale facility at Vanderbijlpark."
SAF_kariba_dam:0 "The Kariba Dam"
SAF_kariba_dam_desc:0 "Finishing the Kariba Dam will take long and arduous work, but it will provide plenty of energy for our expanding industry in Rhodesia."

SAF_industrialization:0 "Focus on Industrialisation"
SAF_industrialization_desc:0 "The Gesuiwerde are pushing for increased industrialisation, but the cost at this stage could be prohibitive. Nevertheless, we must push forwards to solve the current crisis."
SAF_new_resources_1:0 "Industrial Mining"
SAF_new_resources_1_desc:0 "Industrialisation continues at an impressive pace with new mines opening every month across the Orange Free State and the Transvaal. The roads of Johannesburg and Pretoria equal that of any European city. But there is discontent rising from the British provinces, who believe that our programme is unfairly weighted towards the Afrikaans speaking areas."
SAF_industrialization_1:0 "The Witwatersrand Basin"
SAF_industrialization_1_desc:0 "We have begun our efforts to further industrialise our nation. Through the entire Witwatersrand basin roads and railway tracks are being built and new steel mills constructed, bringing thousands back into the workforce."
SAF_shipbuilding_1:0 "Expand the Cape Dockyards"
SAF_shipbuilding_1_desc:0 "One obvious place we can develop our industry is in the shipbuilding sector of Cape Town - the dockyards are sorely in need of updating and expansion, and increasing their capacity will put a large number of people to work."
SAF_entente_help:0 "Seek Help from the Entente"
SAF_entente_help_desc:0 "In an effort to bring our economy back from the crash brought on by German trade dependence, the Dominion Party has suggested looking back towards the old empires for new trade opportunities. It is hoped that in so doing, British and French investment will create job opportunities for South Africa's unemployed."
SAF_foreign_investment:0 "Encourage Foreign Investment"
SAF_foreign_investment_desc:0 "Now that the Entente has normalised trade, the time has come to entice their investors to come to South Africa and help us in the industrialisation process."
SAF_new_resources_2:0 "Kimberley Mines"
SAF_new_resources_2_desc:0 "The influx of capital from the Entente continues to grow our economy. New mines have opened in Kimberley, but some members of the Gesuiwerde and even our own party have spoken out against the clear focus on British dominated parts of the country."
SAF_work_programs:0 "Establish Work Programs"
SAF_work_programs_desc:0 "The majority of the party is in support of a general work programme for the unemployed, this being a safe bet to get our economy back on its feet once again."
SAF_infrastructure_1:0 "Major Roadworks"
SAF_infrastructure_1_desc:0 "The Union is in dire need of better roads even in its southern territories. Luckily, we now have access to a lot of city labour ready to link up the Natal, Transvaal and Cape provinces."
SAF_new_resources_3:0 "Orange River Mines"
SAF_new_resources_3_desc:0 "Our improved infrastructure now allows us to exploit new ore veins on the Orange River. A transport hub is also to be constructed at Hopetown to help with the exploitation of the mineral riches."
SAF_military_factories:0 "Build Military Factories"
SAF_military_factories_desc:0 "It will take a large number of resources, but one way the government can put people to work is by investing in our military infrastructure. We have the natural resources to develop our military - now all we need is the will to make it matter."
SAF_recovery:0 "The South African Recovery"
SAF_recovery_desc:0 "Finally we are in a position to put Black Monday behind us once and for all. Let us move forward into an era of strength for the South African economy!"
SAF_industrial_focus:0 "Focus on Industry"
SAF_industrial_focus_desc:0 "With Black Monday behind us, our focus should be on our civilian industry - it is the backbone of our economy, and the primary way we'll keep people working."
SAF_military_focus:0 "Focus on the Military"
SAF_military_focus_desc:0 "With Black Monday behind us, our focus should be on our military infrastructure - this will keep South Africa strong, as well as keep the economy moving."
SAF_trade_focus:0 "Focus on Trade"
SAF_trade_focus_desc:0 "With Black Monday behind us, we should renew our efforts to keep trade going. Despite the wishes of some, we cannot cut ourselves off from the world. South Africa is a small country, in the bigger picture, and it relies on trade with larger nations to remain vital."
