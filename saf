
SAF_1938_elections:0 "The 1938 General Elections"
SAF_1938_elections_desc:0 "Scheduled to take place in May of 1938, the South African General Elections will probably be the most polarised our country has ever seen, with two radically different views of our country's future in play. The stakes are high, as whoever wins will choose the path forward, and there are no obvious favourites yet."

SAF_nationalist_victory:0 "National Party Victory!"
SAF_nationalist_victory_desc:0 "The decision has been made, and it is the National Party which has emerged victorious from an incredibly contentious election. Now we must move forward and decide how quickly our policies of racial segregation will be organised and implemented. This is the fruition of ambitions which have been many years in the planning."
SAF_implement_apartheid:0 "Implement Apartheid"
SAF_implement_apartheid_desc:0 "After a period of consolidation, we are now in a position to strengthen existing segregation laws to bring about full separation of the four South African nations both socially and politically. The Volksraad is behind us and set to carry our governments programme through."
SAF_broderbond:0 "The Broederbond"
SAF_broderbond_desc:0 "The Broederbond is a clandestine organisation that has been long established in the National Party, with the goal of furthering the interests of the Afrikaner nation. Now with the British subsumed and the natives controlled through apartheid, the Broederbond has take full control of the country's socio-political landscape. The economy has fallen into their hands as well, with many high profile businessmen also members."
SAF_join_mitteleuropa:0 "Join the Reichspakt"
SAF_join_mitteleuropa_desc:0 "Now that we have a firm grasp on our internal politics we should seek to expand our foreign ties, the perfect way to do this would be by requesting to formally join the Reichspakt"
SAF_german_exchange:0 "Ties with Germany"
SAF_german_exchange_desc:0 "Our alliance with the German Empire is only the beginning - we should increase our ties with the Reichspakt, to ensure we are not simply considered a fringe member with no real purpose in their larger alliance."
SAF_diplo_isolation:0 "We Are On Our Own"
SAF_diplo_isolation_desc:0 "We are part of no alliance, and - quite frankly - we should keep it that way. South Africa has suffered in the past by getting drawn into conflicts which have no relevance to our nation, and we should instead focus on our own interests."
SAF_defense_focus:0 "Focus on Defence"
SAF_defense_focus_desc:0 "We know all to well that other countries may choose not to leave us be. It's in our interests to see to our own defence and shore up our borders before the chaos at work in the world comes to our doorstep."
SAF_african_gold:0 "South African Gold"
SAF_african_gold_desc:0 "South Africa's deposits of gold and diamonds are the envy of the world. It's time we nationalised many of these mines and used their profits to subsidise the government's efforts elsewhere."
SAF_develop_capital:0 "The Jewel of South Africa"
SAF_develop_capital_desc:0 "South African gold will fund the development of our glorious capital - an expansion of its industry, its infrastructure, and its defence. It is, after all, the beating heart of our nation."
SAF_expansionism:0 "New Expansionism"
SAF_expansionism_desc:0 "There is an attitude among many within our party that South Africa is a strong nation whose influence should not stop at our northern borders. Perhaps it is time we considered a more aggressive stance?"
SAF_northern_border:0 "The Northern Borderlands"
SAF_northern_border_desc:0 "We now cast our eyes northward - to ensure that we are well-defended, should enemies march south, but also perhaps to enforce a claim on territory which is, by any reasonable yardstick, our natural borders."
SAF_focus_inward:0 "Focus Inward"
SAF_focus_inward_desc:0 "The time is not right for us to look elsewhere - to tell it truthfully, we have only barely made it to this point without our nation flying apart at the seams. Let us focus on establishing order in our own house before looking to expand elsewhere."
SAF_push_for_unity:0 "A Push for Unity"
SAF_push_for_unity_desc:0 "Our nation is, in many ways, still sorely divided. We must make an effort to shore up our support and enforce order - even if that order is something which must be maintained by force."

SAF_dominion_victory:0 "Dominion Party Victory!"
SAF_dominion_victory_desc:0 "The decision has been made, and it is the Dominion Party which has emerged victorious from an incredibly contentious election. Now we must move forward with a mandate to not only return to the fold of the British Empire proper, but to reorganise the entire structure of the South African government."
SAF_implement_federation:0 "Implement the Federation"
SAF_implement_federation_desc:0 "While we have been calling ourselves the South African Federation for a while, we have not yet implemented all the reforms we needed to make that change official. With the country stabilised and our opposition beaten, we can now move and rewrite the Constitution. The Union is no more, but South Africa lives on."
SAF_natives_trust_act:0 "Natives Trust Act"
SAF_natives_trust_act_desc:0 "The Natives Trust Act provides for the existence of native-administrated tribal land, and grants a great deal of autonomy for them in addition to ensuring a minimum of 20 percent of state land must be marked as such. The former Boer Republics of the Orange Free State and Transvaal keep at the minimum threshold, with that figure rising in the British states, and a majority of the High Commission Territories will be given over to be governed by established Paramount Chiefs."
SAF_rejoin_entente:0 "Rejoin the Entente"
SAF_rejoin_entente_desc:0 "Now that we have a firm grip on our internal politics we should seek to rectify the biggest mistake of our history and formally request to rejoin the Empire and Entente."
SAF_the_restoration:0 "The Restoration"
SAF_the_restoration_desc:0 "We have been accepted back into the British Empire, the National Assembly today passing the Restoration Act - restoring the King's position as South Africa's head of state. The former premier, Jan Smuts, looks set to be appointed as Governor-General, however we now have to decide how much power that position can exercise on the Kings behalf."
SAF_qualified_franchise_act:0 "Qualified Franchise Act"
SAF_qualified_franchise_act_desc:0 "The Qualified Franchise Act requires all states to ensure native representation and integration into the political process of South Africa. This is most prominent in the Cape, where the qualified franchise is the most inclusive and full adult suffrage is granted to the Coloured & Asiatic populations. The same is true in Natal for the Asiatics, with the second largest franchise in South Africa."
SAF_united_south_africa:0 "A United South Africa!"
SAF_united_south_africa_desc:0 "With the federal model fully implemented and our laws revised to make the natives a full and functional arm of our country, South Africa is now a truly united nation."
SAF_native_service:0 "Native Service"
SAF_native_service_desc:0 "Our native population serves as a large portion of our armed forces - but only in an enlisted capacity. Perhaps the time has come to expand their role, to not only improve our army's organisation ability but perhaps also to attract new recruits into a service that welcomes them rather than simply makes use of them."
SAF_found_RSAF:0 "Found the RSAF"
SAF_found_RSAF_desc:0 "The South African Air Service, prior to federation, was under-funded and not really considered an independent branch of the military. The talented young officer, Adolph Malan, has petitioned the government to request aid from our British allies in acquiring older planes to establish the new Royal South African Air Force."
