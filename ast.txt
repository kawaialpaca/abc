austral.300.t:0 "Prince George Killed in Crash"
austral.300.d:0 "A recent crash by a small plane on its way to New Zealand claimed several lives - among them the Governor General of [Root.GetNameDef], Prince George. The country is in mourning, angered by the loss of the young prince, and a royal commission is currently looking into the cause of the disaster... even though, truth be told, little wreckage has been found in the Pacific waters after weeks of search. In the meantime, the prince's elder brother - Prince Henry, the Duke of Gloucester - has arrived in [Root.GetNameDef] as his replacement. Sadly, Prince Henry's first act as Governor General will be to attend the funeral for his brother."
austral.300.a:0 "A sad loss"
austral.301.t:0 "Death of Joseph Lyons"
austral.301.d:0 "Today, the Australasian Parliament mourns the loss of Joseph A. Lyons. He is remembered fondly by all sides of politics, despite defecting from the Labor party and becoming one of the leaders of the Nationalist party. His legacy however will be one of hardship and determination, which was shown when he, along with Stanley Bruce, continued to push for democratic elections at the risk of dismissal. He was also partially responsible for implementing policies to help alleviate the worst of the depression and, despite the failure of the Nationalists, he was seen fondly amongst many of the general populace for making the best of what he had."
austral.301.a:0 "He shall be missed"
austral.302.t:0 "Fred Paterson Shot!"
austral.302.d:0 "As the Australasian Council of Trade Unions prepares itself for the coming first Congress, the government has become a hotbed of infighting and political manoeuvring. Perhaps as a result of this, syndicalist leader Fred Paterson was shot earlier this morning while exiting his offices in Canberra. Rushed immediately to hospital, Paterson was pronounced in good condition and is expected to make a swift recovery, though the assailant has yet to be caught. Calls have gone out from the highest levels of the ACTU appealing for calm and an orderly transition of power once the Congress is held."

austral.303.d.gov:0 "After 23 years of politics and controversy, Prime Minister Stanley Bruce has decided to step down as leader of the United Australasia Party. This has thrown his party into considerable chaos, with several declaring his decision untimely, and an immediate struggle has begun to find his replacement."
austral.303.d.notgov:0 "After 23 years of politics and controversy, Stanley Bruce has decided to step down as leader of the United Australasia Party. This has thrown his party into considerable chaos as they search for a replacement, though there appears to be a consensus that it was Bruce's lack of leadership which led to the party's current status. They see this as an opportunity for the UAP's renewal."

austral.304.d:0 "Earle Page, dissatisfied with the election of Robert Menzies as leader of the United Australasia Party, has launched a scathing attack on Menzies' integrity stating, 'the Australiasian Government needs a leader with not merely the qualities I have mentioned, but also the three essential qualities of courage, loyalty, and judgement.' The coalition between the UAP and the Country party appears to be at a permanent end, with Page severing all agreements between the parties effective immediately."

austral.306.d:0 "Due to his decreasing health and enduring a series of leadership arguments which have rocked the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, J.B. Miles finally agreed to resign his position as leader of the Maximists. Before his resignation Miles was virtually powerless as the Chairman, with those who suggesting that his successor, Lance Sharkey, was the one who slowly eroded Miles' leadership. What has been broadcast so far implies and that Miles' resignation was far from willing, but questions regarding the matter are so far very few. Despite this Miles has reaffirmed his commitment to the Maximists and will continue to support them."

austral.307.t:0 "Death of David Murray Anderson"
austral.307.d:0 "Today all flags within Sydney are being flow at half-mast after the sudden death of Sir David Murray Anderson. Sir Anderson, the current sitting governor of New South Wales, is most famously known for his successful evacuation of the British Colonies in the East Indies, saving thousands of lives as well as a large portion of the British Pacific Fleet. While Sir Anderson has been ill for some time, leaving Sir Phillip Street to fill in for his public appearances, he has been vocal in supporting the Australasian Guard as 'the only right-thinking men in Australasia' who would be capable of enacting his plans to retake the East Indies. His death has only further built support for the right-wing movement."
austral.307.a:0 "A fine man"
austral.308.t:0 "Resignation of Fred Paterson"
austral.308.d:0 "The 'People's Champion' Fred Paterson, after years of strong leadership, has decided to step down as Chairman of the ACTU citing family and health as the reason. While he may no longer be the leader of the ACTU, he will take over as vice-chairman for the new leader. The first choice to replace him is Elsie Farrelly, a renowned socialist and feminist who made several succesful strides to empower working class women. The other choice is the scholar and philosopher, John Anderson. He has pushed for many reforms to help our comrades seek higher education and pursue greater knowledge. Both are quite worthy of the position but only one can be chosen."

austral.309.d.hog:0 "Having suffered from deteriorating health for a number of years, Prime Minister John Curtin today died of heart failure at the Lodge in Canberra. The longtime leader of the Labor party, Curtin was well-respected across the country but being Prime Minister led to a sharp decline in his health over the previous few years. His body was returned to his home city of Perth on a RAAF Dakota, escorted by a flight of nine fighter aircraft. After lying in state, he was buried at Karrakatta Cemetery in Perth, with his funeral route being lined by over 100,000 people with the service itself being attended by over 30,000."
