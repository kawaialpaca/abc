austral.243.t:0 "Conscription Riots in New Zealand 뉴질랜드에서의 징병 폭동"
austral.243.d.forced:0 "Nowhere has the issue of conscription been more sensitive than in New Zealand, a territory that already felt it was joined to [Root.GetNameDev] unwillingly by the Consolidation Of Resources Act in 1924. Now that conscription has been forced on the nation by the [Root.GetAdjective] government, riots have broken out across the state - with many rioters angrily burning [Root.GetAdjective] flags and vowing that New Zealand should not be part of the confederation at all. 이미 1924년의 자원 보존법에 의해 [Root.GetNameDev]에 강제적으로 합류되었다고 느끼는 뉴질랜드 지역보다 징병 문제에 더 민감한 곳은 없습니다. 지금 [Root.GetAdjective] 정부가 징병을 강제하면서 폭동이 주 전역에서 일어났습니다 - 많은 폭도들은 분노하여 [Root.GetAdjective]의 깃발을 불태우며 뉴질랜드가 더이상 연방의 일부로 있지 않을 것을 다짐하고 있습니다."
austral.243.d.voted:0 "As the votes were being counted it soon became clear that the Yay-side would carry the day. However, complications have arisen since New Zealand overwhelmingly voted no to confederate conscription while mainland Australians mainly voted yes. As a territory which already feels it was forced into confederation by the Consolidation Of Resources Act in 1924, feelings are running raw and several riots have broken out in Auckland and elsewhere, demanding a referendum be held in the state to determine its future as part of Australasia. 선거 집계 결과 찬성파가 승리한 것이 확실해보입니다. 하지만 뉴질랜드가 연방의 선거에서 압도적으로 반대에 투표한 반면 본토의 호주인들은 대부분 찬성에 투표하면서 분란이 일어났습니다. 이미 1924년의 자원 보존법에 의해 [Root.GetNameDev]에 강제적으로 합류되었다고 느끼는 뉴질랜드 지역에서는 분위기가 거칠어져가고 있고 오클랜드 등지에서는 주에 앞으로 오스트랄라시아의 일부로 남을지를 결정할 주민 투표를 요구하는 폭동이 일어났습니다."

austral.245.t:0 "The Australasian Guard Backs Us On Conscription 오스트랄라시아 수비대가 징병 문제에서 우리를 지지하다"
austral.245.d:0 "Charles Vyner Brooke, one of the leading figures in the Australasian Guard and its political front, the Centre Party, has today endorsed the governments successful adoption of conscription. While we may not feel comfortable being complemented by the far right, it is better that than the alternative, as Brooke's support of the Centre Party has seen it grow in strength since the last election. 오스트랄라시아 수비대와 그 정치적 동맹 중앙당의 유명인사 찰스 바이너 브룩이 오늘 정부의 징병 제도의 성공적인 도입을 지지했습니다. 극우파에게 칭찬을 듣는 일이 편안하게 느껴지지는 않지만 지난 선거 이후 브룩의 중앙당에 대한 지지는 그 세력을 강하게 한 듯하기 때문에 그 반대의 경우보다는 더 낫습니다."

austral.246.d:0 "Charles Vyner Brooke, one of the leading figures in the Australasian Guard and its political front the Centre Party, has today attacked the government over its failure to adopt conscription. This is not a dismissable threat, as Brooke's support of the Centre Party has seen it grow in strength since the last election. 오스트랄라시아 수비대와 그 정치적 동맹 중앙당의 유명인사 찰스 바이너 브룩이 오늘 징병제도의 도입의 실패로 정부를 공격했습니다. 지난 선거 이후 브룩의 중앙당에 대한 지지는 그 세력을 강하게 한 듯하기 때문에 이는 무시할 수 있는 정도의 위협이 아닙니다."

austral.247.t:0 "Nationalists Support the Centre Party 국민당이 중앙당을 지지하다"
austral.247.d:0 "Support for Billy Hughes' Nationalist Party has waned significantly since the 1936 election. As more and more of their supporters and members have left to join either Stanley Bruce's UAP or the emerging force of Eric Campbell and his Centre Party, Hughes has ultimately decided to throw his lot in with the Australasian Guard. No longer splitting the far right vote, the Guard is now a serious contender in the next federal election. 빌리 휴즈의 중앙당에 대한 지지도는 1936년 선거 이래로 심각하게 감소해왔습니다. 그들의 지지자들과 당원들이 점점 더 스탠리 브루스의 UAP나 떠오르는 세력인 에릭 켐벨과 중앙당에 합류하기 위해 떠나면서 휴즈는 최종적으로 오스트랄라시아 수비대와 운명을 같이하기로 결정했습니다. 더 이상 극우파들의 표가 갈리지 않게되면서 수비대는 다음 연방 선거의 만만찮은 경쟁자로 떠올랐습니다."

austral.250.d.gbr:0 "With the British home islands having been restored and the crisis considered over, the state government of New Zealand is being pressured by its people to consider a referendum on independence from [Root.GetNameDef]. New Zealand was only folded into the Confederation by the Consolidation of Resources Act, a measure which is seen as no longer necessary. Considering the riots in the state following the imposition of conscription, chances are considered quite good that they would vote to secede. 대영제국의 본토가 회복되고 위기가 끝난 것으로 간주되면서 뉴질랜드 주정부는 시민들에게 [Root.GetNameDef]으로부터의 독립하는 주민투표를 고려해 볼 것을 압박받고 있습니다. 뉴질랜드는 자원 보존법으로 연방에 들어갔을 뿐이며 그 조치는 더이상 불필요하게 보입니다. 징병제 도입 이후의 주에서의 폭동을 고려해볼 때 그들이 투표에서 성공할 가능성은 꽤나 높은 것으로 간주됩니다."

austral.253.t:0 "New Zealand Votes to Leave"
austral.253.d:0 "After a month of voting across the state, with turnout very high, New Zealand has voted to leave [Root.GetNameDef]. The vote in favour of the motion was exceedingly high, enough so that few are attempting to claim that the island does not have a democratic imperative to secede. Indeed, the state is already taking measures to sever governmental ties with the mainland."

austral.254.t:0 "Day of Mourning"
austral.254.d:0 "Today marks the 150th anniversary of the first fleet landing in Australia. While many mainland Australians are celebrating the day, the native aborigines are mourning the loss of their land and the suffering of their people. In response, and with the assistance of the Australasia First Movement, the Aborigines Progressive Association has held a protest for equal rights, full citizenship, and better education for all Australian aboriginal peoples. Jack Patten, the leader of the organisation and a notable member of AFM, stated 'Give us the chance! We do not wish to be left behind in Australasia's march to progress. We ask for full citizen rights...'. This protest has garnered mixed reviews, but in turn has gained support from both the aboriginal population for the AFM as well as egalitarians frustrated with left-wing politics."

austral.255.d:0 "Farmers in Walgoolan and Burracoppin have petitioned the government to help cull a rather large gathering of emus in the area. They asked for planes to drop small bombs on large gatherings, along with soldiers armed with machine guns to shoot down the rest, similar to the failed attempt in 1932. The Chief Game Inspector, Mr A. Arnold, stated 'The situation did not warrant mass extermination of the birds' and that inspectors had not spotted any of the so-called reported mass gatherings. The state government has also denied the request on the basis of the Mr Arnold's observation."
austral.255.a:0 "A war on Emus is unnecessary"
austral.256.t:0 "The Volunteer Defence Corps"
austral.256.d:0 "In response to the return of world war, the Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL) has been tasked with forming a militia force comprised of both Weltkrieg veterans too old to fight overseas and men too young to enlist. The intent of this militia is to create a static defence against invasion and if that was to fail, the VDC would then engage in guerrilla warfare against the invaders. From there they would delay, harass, and perhaps totally defeat an invader's plans."
austral.256.a:0 "An excellent idea"

austral.258.d:0 "Today both Donald Cameron and John Garden have been engaged in talks with the Labor Party leadership to rejoin the party's ranks. While members within the party support the idea to bolster Labor's working class support, others like the vocal Jack Lang have called out such an idea as ridiculous and a danger to the Labor movement. If we accept them back, there is a good chance Jack Lang will break off yet again, though the increased working class support might be worth the risk."

austral.260.t:0 "Reconcile with Lang Labor?"
austral.260.d:0 "The possibility of finally reconciling with Jack Lang and his breakaway members of the Labor Party - though to do so would mean offering at least Lang himself a position within the Labor cabinet. Is that worth the effort, even though Lang's tempestuous nature makes the entire endeavour unlikely to succeed?"

Ngata stated, 'We are participants in a great Confederation, to the defence of which we cannot hesitate to contribute our blood and our lives. We are the possessors of rights which we must qualify to exercise, also of obligations which the M?ori must discharge always in the future as he has done in the past.' Some members, however, find the idea of a sole Battalion dedicated to the M?ori unsustainable due to the lower population, while others say they would be better off as supporting roles as they did during the Weltkrieg."
austral.263.a:0 "This will only help the war effort"

Witnesses reported that when Anker Madsen, one of his neighbours rode by on his bike, Stanley shot him in the leg.

Before Graham could be stopped, he took the lives of 14 across the three weeks he'd been running. While the specifics are not known as to why Mr. Graham began his spree, police reports show he had a history of threats and assault. Following the shootings, the Graham household was burned down, and the government has shifted his wife and children across the country. Plans are in the making to build a memorial on the former site of Mr Graham's house as a tribute to those who died."
